# About Gamblr
Gamblr is a crypto paper trading app aimed at young investors looking to enter the crypto space. It allows them a place to safely and accurately paper trade based on historical data, and offers insight against passive investment portfolios. 

Gamblr, as the name suggests, is created with the idea in mind that active day trading of cryptos is essentially akin to gambling, especially to the unexperienced. As young adults (the primary demographic of new investors) are extra susceptible to gambling addictions, this app attempts to teach a lesson about the value of passive investing, and that day trading is not a viable way to get rich quick. After enough trades, it is expected that the calculated passive portfolio will have greater returns that the user's portfolio. This, while a product of nature and not design, is prominently displayed in an effort to make the user aware of the difficulty of beating the market. 

Ultimately, while Gamblr is in essence just a paper trading application, hopefully through its use users will become more educated on not only trading strategies, but also the dangers of active trading as well. Building wealth at a young age is crucial to long term life goals, and far too many young people have squandered savings trying to get rich quick. Gamblr wants to help end that problem in the emerging crypto space before it begins.
